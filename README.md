# Kelvin Ifeanyi — My All-Inclusive Interactive Portfolio

A lightweight, book-style portfolio built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. The layout simulates a physical book where pages turn when the chevron buttons are clicked. This portfolio project showcases my skills, experience, projects and contact information.

## Demo
Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the project with a static server (recommended) to ensure assets and scripts load correctly.

## Features
- Book-like page-turn animation (CSS 3D + JavaScript)
- Profile page with social links and CV button
- Work experience, education, services and skills pages
- Latest project showcase and contact form
- Fully static — no backend required

## Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3 (flexbox, transforms, transitions)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Static assets stored in `/assets`

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. From the project root, open `index.html` in your browser:
   - Double-click `index.html` or
   - Serve with a local server (recommended):
     - VS Code: use the Live Server extension

## Usage
- Click the chevron icons to turn pages forward/backward.
- The page-turn behavior is handled in `script.js`.
- Page content is in `index.html` and styles are in `styles.css`.

## File Structure (key files)
- index.html — main markup
- styles.css — all styling
- script.js — page-turn logic
- /assets — images and icons
